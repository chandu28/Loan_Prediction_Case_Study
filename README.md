# Loan_Prediction_Case_Study
Credit risk analysis 

In this case study I have used algortihms which makes the best fit for the prediction of target value for this case study and checked its perfomance across algorithms used and submitted which gives the best in Analytics Vidhya website.As for as know I have kust implemented the algorithm which I am familiar with and in the process of exploring new algorithms I would update the code with that new algorithm implementation.

# Problem Statement

This case study deals with whether to provide loan to a individual based on several features considered in the banking sector and other features with respect to this data.Nowadays there are many features to be considered for this case study but this is just a sample to make predictions off.Again it is a classifier problem so we must use algortithsm which are good for predicted target vakue in terms of discrete and evaluate based on confusion matrix and accuracy scores.

# Datasets

The data which is required for this problem statement is provided in the data folder along with sample submission file

# Process

#import the train data
#carry out exploratory analysis
           univariate, bivariate, multivariate
           
#check out skew, normal distribution and other plots and graphs based on the data and the features 
#Check out missing values 
#impute them with most likely hood method or amelia incase of R or any method of imputation
#Label the categorical value incase of python language used as the ML algorithm doesnt understand humaqn language it can just understand machine language just as numbers
#Use cross validation method incase of R for better perfomance of model evaluation and use test train split incase of Python for cheking the perfomance within train and later compare thenm with test data
#Fit the model
#Predict the target value and evaluate based on the target value of train data and try to carryout in test also and find the output by submission in respective hackathons participating
